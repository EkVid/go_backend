### go.mod
This file is used for dependency management and stores the dependencies needed to build and run the program. It can be initialized with the command go mod init <module_name>. It identifies dependencies from the import statements and creates an entry for them in this file.

### go.sum
This file is also part of the dependency management in Golang. It is essentially a checksum for the dependencies to ensure that dependency is installed only once and with the correct version.

### main.go
This is the main entry point of our code, responsible for setting up the backend server, configuring logging, applying middleware, and defining API routes.
